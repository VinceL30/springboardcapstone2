# springboardcapstone2

This is my jupyter notebook used for Capstone 2 of my Springboard Data Analytics boot camp.

My initial 4 notebooks were messy and used 4 different data sets. Eventually, I was able to use what I learned from those previous notebooks to come to this final one. This final notebook is cleaner, and much more basic. That said, it gives me all the data I need to complete my final capstone.
